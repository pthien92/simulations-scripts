# Simulations

The simulations for ns3, mininet and omnet++ mentioned in TRIDENTCOM 2019 Paper: "Enabling Heterogeneous 5G Simulations with SDN Adapters"

# Some notes

## scripts
Useful scripts: create, remove, run simulations from commandline interface

## ns3-sdn

The slightly-modified version of the default OFSwitch13 QoS scenario

## results-summary

The data files in this folder are used for plotting figures in the paper.



# Troubleshoot
* If ovs-testcontroller is running, it may occupy the port 6633 slot already, so kill that process first.
* Place ns3-related scripts in scratch folder of the ns3 directory is the easiest way to get those compiled and run
